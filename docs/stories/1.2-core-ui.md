# Story 1.2: Core Application Shell & UI Integration

## User Story
As a **user**,
I want to **experience a consistent and customizable application layout with integrated UI components and navigation**,
so that **every page and component is developed within the correct visual framework from the start.**

## Status
Draft

## Epic
Epic 1: Foundation, Core UI, & Cohort Report (MVP)

## Acceptance Criteria
1. The application displays a persistent Shadcn sidebar on all protected routes, containing navigation links to reports and a `NavUser` component that includes links for user settings and additional links for admin functions.
2. The application displays a sticky Shadcn header on all protected routes.
3. The header displays breadcrumbs for navigation context.
4. The header dynamically renders a filter button (via a portal) when a report page is active.
5. Theming (dark/light/system mode) is implemented and functional, with system as default.
6. Content layout preference (centered/full-width) is implemented and functional.
7. A centralized `sonner` toast notification system is integrated and displays a test message in the left-bottom corner.
8. The UI adheres to the aesthetic guidelines of Vercel and Notion, and uses Geist font.
9. All core layout components (sidebar, header, main content area) are responsive and functional across supported browsers.

## Dev Notes
Populate relevant information, only what was pulled from actual artifacts from docs folder, relevant to this story:
- Do not invent information
- If known add Relevant Source Tree info that relates to this story
- If there were important notes from previous story that are relevant to this one, include them here
- Put enough information in this section so that the dev agent should NEVER need to read the architecture documents, these notes along with the tasks and subtasks must give the Dev Agent the complete context it needs to comprehend with the least amount of overhead the information to complete the story, meeting all AC and completing all tasks+subtasks
