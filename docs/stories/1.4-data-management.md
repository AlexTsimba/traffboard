# Story 1.4: Data Management & CSV Ingestion

## User Story
As an **administrator**,
I want to **upload affiliate data via CSV files and ensure data quality through deduplication**,
so that **the dashboard has accurate and consistent information for reporting.**

## Status
Draft

## Epic
Epic 1: Foundation, Core UI, & Cohort Report (MVP)

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Admin users can access a dedicated UI for data management.
2. The data management UI provides a mechanism to upload CSV files.
3. Upon CSV upload, the system processes the data and stores it in the PostgreSQL database.
4. The system automatically performs deduplication of records during the data ingestion process.
5. The system provides feedback (e.g., via toast notification) on the success or failure of the CSV upload and deduplication process.
6. Uploaded and deduplicated data is accessible for programmatic report generation.

## Dev Notes
Populate relevant information, only what was pulled from actual artifacts from docs folder, relevant to this story:
- Do not invent information
- If known add Relevant Source Tree info that relates to this story
- If there were important notes from previous story that are relevant to this one, include them here
- Put enough information in this section so that the dev agent should NEVER need to read the architecture documents, these notes along with the tasks and subtasks must give the Dev Agent the complete context it needs to comprehend with the least amount of overhead the information to complete the story, meeting all AC and completing all tasks+subtasks

### Technical Details
- **Database:** PostgreSQL [Source: architecture.md#Database]
- **File Processing:** CSV upload and parsing [Source: architecture.md#Data Ingestion Service]
- **Data Quality:** Automatic deduplication [Source: prd.md#FR6]
- **Feedback:** Toast notifications via Sonner [Source: prd.md#Centralized Toast Notifications]
- **Access Control:** Admin-only functionality [Source: prd.md#FR1]
- **ORM:** Prisma [Source: architecture.md#ORM]
- **Data Models:** `AffiliateTrafficData`, `PlayerConversionData` [Source: architecture.md#Data Models]

### Testing
List Relevant Testing Standards from Architecture the Developer needs to conform to:
- Test file location: `apps/api/src/app/api/data/upload-csv/` for API routes, `apps/web/tests/` for frontend. [Source: architecture.md#Test Organization]
- Test standards: Follow testing pyramid approach (unit, integration, E2E). [Source: architecture.md#Testing Pyramid]
- Testing frameworks and patterns to use: Jest for unit/integration, Playwright for E2E. [Source: architecture.md#Testing Requirements]
- Any specific testing requirements for this story: Test CSV upload with valid/invalid data, deduplication logic, and error handling.
