# Story 1.3: Secure Authentication & User Management

## User Story
As an **administrator**,
I want to **securely manage user accounts and their roles, and enable/disable 2FA for users, supporting email/password and OAuth authentication methods**,
so that **only authorized personnel can access the dashboard and sensitive data is protected.**

## Status
Draft

## Epic
Epic 1: Foundation, Core UI, & Cohort Report (MVP)

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Authenticated users with the 'admin' role can access a **properly designed user management page with a table view**.
2. From the user management page, admin users can:
   - **Add new user accounts** with assigned roles (e.g., **'admin', 'user'**).
   - **Delete existing user accounts**.
   - **Disable 2FA for any user**.
   - Perform other relevant administrative user management functions (e.g., edit user roles, reset passwords).
3. User login page integrates `better-auth` and presents users with a choice between:
   - **Email/password authentication.**
   - **OAuth authentication (e.g., Google, Microsoft, etc. - specific providers to be defined).**
4. User login flow allows for 2FA verification on the same page as login credentials.
5. For OAuth authentication, admin must provision or link user accounts; self-registration is not permitted.
6. Protected routes are inaccessible without proper authentication and authorization.
7. User sessions are securely managed.

## Dev Notes
Populate relevant information, only what was pulled from actual artifacts from docs folder, relevant to this story:
- Do not invent information
- If known add Relevant Source Tree info that relates to this story
- If there were important notes from previous story that are relevant to this one, include them here
- Put enough information in this section so that the dev agent should NEVER need to read the architecture documents, these notes along with the tasks and subtasks must give the Dev Agent the complete context it needs to comprehend with the least amount of overhead the information to complete the story, meeting all AC and completing all tasks+subtasks

### Technical Details
- **Authentication Library:** `better-auth` [Source: architecture.md#Authentication]
- **User Roles:** admin, user [Source: architecture.md#Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)]
- **2FA:** Required capability [Source: prd.md#FR2]
- **OAuth Providers:** Google, Microsoft (TBD) [Source: prd.md#FR1]
- **Security:** No self-registration for OAuth [Source: prd.md#FR1]
- **Database:** PostgreSQL [Source: architecture.md#Database]
- **ORM:** Prisma [Source: architecture.md#ORM]

### Testing
List Relevant Testing Standards from Architecture the Developer needs to conform to:
- Test file location: `apps/api/src/app/api/auth/` for API routes, `apps/web/tests/` for frontend. [Source: architecture.md#Test Organization]
- Test standards: Follow testing pyramid approach (unit, integration, E2E). [Source: architecture.md#Testing Pyramid]
- Testing frameworks and patterns to use: Jest for unit/integration, Playwright for E2E. [Source: architecture.md#Testing Requirements]
- Any specific testing requirements for this story: Comprehensive testing of all authentication flows, role-based access, and user management functions.
