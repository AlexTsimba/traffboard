# Story 1.5: Programmatic Cohort Report

## User Story
As an **affiliate**,
I want to **generate a Cohort Report based on selected parameters**,
so that **I can quickly analyze affiliate performance trends.**

## Status
Draft

## Epic
Epic 1: Foundation, Core UI, & Cohort Report (MVP)

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Users can navigate to the Cohort Report page via the sidebar.
2. The Cohort Report page displays a filter button in the header (via portal).
3. Clicking the filter button opens a filter panel with global and report-specific parameters for the Cohort Report.
4. Users can select parameters (e.g., date ranges, cohorts) within the filter panel.
5. Applying filters generates and displays the Cohort Report based on the selected parameters.
6. The Cohort Report displays accurate data from the ingested CSVs.
7. The report loads and displays within 3 seconds.

## Dev Notes
Populate relevant information, only what was pulled from actual artifacts from docs folder, relevant to this story:
- Do not invent information
- If known add Relevant Source Tree info that relates to this story
- If there were important notes from previous story that are relevant to this one, include them here
- Put enough information in this section so that the dev agent should NEVER need to read the architecture documents, these notes along with the tasks and subtasks must give the Dev Agent the complete context it needs to comprehend with the least amount of overhead the information to complete the story, meeting all AC and completing all tasks+subtasks

### Technical Details
- **Charting Library:** Shadcn Charts [Source: architecture.md#Charting Library]
- **Data Processing:** Arquero for in-memory operations [Source: architecture.md#Data Manipulation]
- **Performance:** 3-second load requirement [Source: prd.md#NFR1]
- **Navigation:** Sidebar integration [Source: prd.md#Key Interaction Paradigms]
- **Filtering:** Portal-based filter button in header [Source: prd.md#Dynamic Filter System]
- **Database:** PostgreSQL [Source: architecture.md#Database]
- **ORM:** Prisma [Source: architecture.md#ORM]

### Testing
List Relevant Testing Standards from Architecture the Developer needs to conform to:
- Test file location: `apps/web/tests/` for frontend. [Source: architecture.md#Test Organization]
- Test standards: Follow testing pyramid approach (unit, integration, E2E). [Source: architecture.md#Testing Pyramid]
- Testing frameworks and patterns to use: Jest for unit/integration, Playwright for E2E. [Source: architecture.md#Testing Requirements]
- Any specific testing requirements for this story: Test report generation with various filters, data accuracy, and performance under load.
