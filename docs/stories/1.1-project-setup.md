# Story 1.1: Project Setup & Basic Deployment

## User Story
As a **developer**,
I want to **set up the monorepo with Next.js 15, Shadcn UI, and PostgreSQL, and deploy a basic application to DigitalOcean**,
so that **I have a foundational project structure and can continuously deploy a working application.**

## Status
Ready to dev

## Epic
Epic 1: Foundation, Core UI, & Cohort Report (MVP)

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Monorepo initialized with Next.js 15.
2. Shadcn UI configured and integrated into the project.
3. PostgreSQL database connected (local development setup).
4. A basic "Hello World" page is successfully deployed to DigitalOcean App Platform.
5. CI/CD pipeline configured via GitHub for automated deployment from the `main` branch to DigitalOcean.
6. Jest and Playwright test frameworks are integrated and a basic test runs successfully.

## Dev Notes
Populate relevant information, only what was pulled from actual artifacts from docs folder, relevant to this story:
- Do not invent information
- If known add Relevant Source Tree info that relates to this story
- If there were important notes from previous story that are relevant to this one, include them here
- Put enough information in this section so that the dev agent should NEVER need to read the architecture documents, these notes along with the tasks and subtasks must give the Dev Agent the complete context it needs to comprehend with the least amount of overhead the information to complete the story, meeting all AC and completing all tasks+subtasks
