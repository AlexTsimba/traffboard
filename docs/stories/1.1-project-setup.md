# Story 1.1: Project Setup & Basic Deployment

## User Story
As a **developer**,
I want to **set up the monorepo with Next.js 15, Shadcn UI, and PostgreSQL, and deploy a basic application to DigitalOcean**,
so that **I have a foundational project structure and can continuously deploy a working application.**

## Status
Draft

## Epic
Epic 1: Foundation, Core UI, & Cohort Report (MVP)

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Monorepo initialized with Next.js 15.
2. Shadcn UI configured and integrated into the project.
3. PostgreSQL database connected (local development setup).
4. A basic "Hello World" page is successfully deployed to DigitalOcean App Platform.
5. CI/CD pipeline configured via GitHub for automated deployment from the `main` branch to DigitalOcean.
6. Jest and Playwright test frameworks are integrated and a basic test runs successfully.

- [ ] Set up local PostgreSQL database connection with Prisma (AC: 3)
  - [ ] (Optional, User Action) Drop existing local PostgreSQL database if starting fresh.
  - [ ] Ensure local PostgreSQL server is running.
  - [ ] Update `.env` with correct `DATABASE_URL` for local PostgreSQL.
  - [ ] Run `npx prisma migrate dev` to apply schema and create database (if not exists).
  - [ ] Run `npx prisma generate` to generate Prisma client.
  - [ ] Implement a simple database query (e.g., create a test record) to verify connection.
- [ ] Deploy basic "Hello World" to DigitalOcean App Platform (AC: 4)
  - [ ] Create DigitalOcean App Platform application [Source: architecture.md#Platform and Infrastructure Choice]

  - [ ] Create GitHub Actions workflow for deployment to DigitalOcean [Source: architecture.md#CI/CD Pipeline]
  - [ ] Configure DigitalOcean deployment credentials as GitHub secrets [Source: architecture.md#CI/CD Pipeline]
  - [ ] Test automated deployment from `main` branch [Source: architecture.md#CI/CD Pipeline]
- [ ] Integrate Jest and Playwright test frameworks (AC: 6)
  - [ ] Install Jest and Playwright [Source: architecture.md#Testing Requirements]
  - [ ] Configure test runners for Jest and Playwright [Source: architecture.md#Testing Strategy]
  - [ ] Write and run a basic Jest unit test [Source: architecture.md#Testing Strategy]
  - [ ] Write and run a basic Playwright end-to-end test [Source: architecture.md#Testing Strategy]

## Dev Notes
Populate relevant information, only what was pulled from actual artifacts from docs folder, relevant to this story:
- Do not invent information
- If known add Relevant Source Tree info that relates to this story
- If there were important notes from previous story that are relevant to this one, include them here
- Put enough information in this section so that the dev agent should NEVER need to read the architecture documents, these notes along with the tasks and subtasks must give the Dev Agent the complete context it needs to comprehend with the least amount of overhead the information to complete the story, meeting all AC and completing all tasks+subtasks

### Technical Details
- **Frontend Framework:** Next.js 15 [Source: architecture.md#Frontend Framework]
- **UI Component Library:** Shadcn UI [Source: architecture.md#UI Component Library]
- **Database:** PostgreSQL [Source: architecture.md#Database]
- **ORM:** Prisma [Source: architecture.md#ORM]
- **Hosting:** DigitalOcean App Platform [Source: architecture.md#Platform and Infrastructure Choice]
- **CI/CD:** GitHub Actions [Source: architecture.md#CI/CD]
- **Testing Frameworks:** Jest, Playwright [Source: architecture.md#Testing Requirements]
- **Repository Structure:** Monorepo [Source: architecture.md#Repository Structure]
- **Service Architecture:** Monolithic [Source: architecture.md#Service Architecture]

### Testing
List Relevant Testing Standards from Architecture the Developer needs to conform to:
- Test file location: `apps/web/tests/` for frontend, `apps/api/tests/` for backend, `tests/e2e/` for E2E. [Source: architecture.md#Test Organization]
- Test standards: Follow testing pyramid approach (unit, integration, E2E). [Source: architecture.md#Testing Pyramid]
- Testing frameworks and patterns to use: Jest for unit/integration, Playwright for E2E. [Source: architecture.md#Testing Requirements]
- Any specific testing requirements for this story: Ensure basic tests for monorepo setup, Shadcn integration, DB connection, and deployment are passing.
